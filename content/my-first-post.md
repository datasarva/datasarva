# Apache Spark Architecture

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides fast and general-purpose data processing for large-scale data sets. It has gained popularity due to its ease of use, high-level APIs, and support for multiple programming languages. The architecture of Apache Spark is designed to efficiently process data in parallel across a cluster of machines.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.{SparkConf, SparkContext}

object SparkExample {

  // Stop the Spark context
  sc.stop()
}

```
